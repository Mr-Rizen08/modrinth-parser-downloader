__Modrinth Parser/Mod Downloader__

ðŸŒ± _Modrinth - is a mod platform for Minecraft._  
This project automates downloading mods from the Modrinth website and includes a parser for managing and processing mod data.
Itâ€™s a personal project I created to make working with Modrinth easier and faster.  

__How to use__  
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all the libraries you need.
